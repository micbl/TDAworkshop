# TDAworkshop
In this twelve-hour workshop the participant will be introduced to the main techniques utilized in topological data analysis and their implementation provided by the python package scikit-tda. Introductions to the Mapper algorithm and persistent homology will be complemented by respective hands-on tutorial sessions. The workshop will conclude with an exploratory project of these methods on ‘real data’, which may be provided by the participants.

On this branch of the repo you will find all material that was used for this course.
In particular, we here collect datasets that are used during the course.
