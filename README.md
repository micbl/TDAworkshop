# TDAworkshop
In this twelve-hour workshop the participant will be introduced to the main techniques utilized in topological data analysis and their implementation provided by the python package scikit-tda. Introductions to the Mapper algorithm and persistent homology will be complemented by respective hands-on tutorial sessions. The workshop will conclude with an exploratory project of these methods on ‘real data’, which may be provided by the participants.

Here we currently collect material for the exercises of the first two days.
