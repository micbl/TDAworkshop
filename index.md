In this twelve-hour workshop the participant will be introduced to the main techniques utilized in topological data analysis and their implementation provided by the python package [scikit-tda](https://scikit-tda.org/).
Introductions to the Mapper algorithm and persistent homology will be complemented by respective hands-on tutorial sessions.
The workshop will conclude with an exploratory project of these methods on 'real data', which can be provided by the participants.
